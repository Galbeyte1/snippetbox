# Structured Logging, Dependency Injection, and Centralized Error Handling

---

### Why Structured Logging ?

I was previously outputting log entries from my code using the `log.Printf()` and
`log.Fatal()` functions but now I started to use Go's `log/slog` package from it's standard library which let's me create custom structured loggers.

For many applications, using the standard logger will be good enough, and thereâ€™s no need to do anything more complex. But for applications which do a lot of logging, I want to make the log entries easier to filter and work with.

This allows for

- Distinguishing between different _severities_ of log entries
- Enforce a consistent structure for log entries so it's easier to parse when using external programs like Datadog, New Relic etc.

I'll use the `slog.New()` function to initialize a new structured logger, which writes to the standard out stream and uses the default settings. It's important to note custom loggers created by `slog.New()` are **concurrency-safe**. We can share a single logger and use it across multiple goroutines and in our HTTP handlers without needing to worry about race conditions.

```Go
logger := slog.New(slog.NewTextHandler(os.Stdout, &slog.HandlerOptions{
    Level:     slog.LevelDebug,
    AddSource: true,
}))
```

I can then write a log entry at a specific severity
level by calling the `Debug()`, `Info()`, `Warn()` or `Error()`

### Dependency Injection

How can we make our new structured logger available to our `func home(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request)` function from `func main()`?

How can we make **ANY** dependency available to our handlers?
There are a few different ways to do this, the simplest being to just make the dependency as a global variable. But in general, it is good practice to inject dependencies into your handlers. It makes your code more

- explicit
- less error-prone
- easier to unit test

than if you use global variables.

Most web applications will have multiple dependencies that their handlers need to access, such as a

- database connection pool,
- centralized error handlers,
- and template caches.

For applications where all the handlers are in the same package, like mine, a neat way to inject dependencies is to put them into a custom application struct, and then define the handler functions as methods against application.

I defined an application struct to hold the application-wide dependencies for the
web application.

```Go
    type application struct {
        logger   *slog.Logger
        snippets *models.SnippetModel
    }
```

I initialized a new instance of our application struct, containing the dependencies

```Go
    app := &application{
        logger:   logger,
        snippets: &models.SnippetModel{DB: db},
    }
```

```Go
func (app *application) home(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
```

Because the home handler is now a method against the application struct it can access its fields, including the structured logger. I can use this to create a log entry at Error level containing the error message, also including the request method and URI as attributes to assist with debugging. Let's introduce better error first.

### Centralized Error Handling

To seperate concerns and stop repeating code as I progress through the build processes I've dedicated error handling to some helper functions

The `serverError` is a method against the application struct and it's a helper which writes a log entries at Error level.

```Go
func (app *application) serverError(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request, err error) {
```

It writes a log entry at this level including the request method and URI as attributes, then sends a generic 500 Internal Server Error response to the user.

```Go
...
    var (
        method = r.Method
        uri = r.URL.RequestURI()

    )

    app.logger.Error(err.Error(), "method", method, "uri", uri)
    http.Error(w, http.StatusText(SERVER_ERROR), SERVER_ERROR)
```

Now as an example, within our `func (app *application) home` handler, we can pass simple centralized, structured error logging as such.

```Go
    ...
    ts, err := template.ParseFiles(files...)
	if err != nil {
        app.serverError(w, r, err)
    }
    ...
```
